# Tibia Party Sessions Merger

Splitting loot right after every party hunting session is more often than not too big of a burden for the players involved.
Thus, some players opt to sell and split it after accumulating the spoils from multiple sessions.
However, dealing with numerous session logs is time consuming given that the total profit has to be manually calculated as the current available tools provide no functionality to merge multiple sessions into one.

Hence, to help players quickly calculate the profit of many session logs at once, this desktop app can be used to easily merge multiple session logs.

# Installation

Simply download the latest [release](https://github.com/ratoobi/tibia-party-sessions-merger/releases/latest) and run it.

# Usage

1. Paste the session logs and click the "Merge" button
	1. You may temporarily store the logs in a text file and copy its contents directly to the app
	2. Note that the raw logs have to go through [TibiaPal's](https://tibiapal.com/tibialootsplit) loot split tool before being pasted

2. The total sum to be transfered to each player will be displayed
	1. Either use the "Copy" button or select and copy manually
