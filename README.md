# Tibia Party Sessions Merger
Tibia Party Sessions Merger is a QoL application designed for the MMORPG Tibia. 
Some players tend to accumulate the spoils of numerous party hunting sessions before splitting it, and dealing with numerous session logs can be time-consuming given that each session has to go through a loot-split-tool one at a time.

This app lets players store multiple session logs in a file and calculate the profit of all sessions at once.
It also supports logs from [TibiaPal's](https://tibiapal.com/tibialootsplit) loot split tool, which is helpful for players that want to store the sessions in a more compact format.
